I developed this application in parallel with [John Smilga tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=731Ur2HGRBY&t=6133s&ab_channel=CodingAddict) to comprehend concept and basic working principles of Redux.

mockAPI is used to create data rather than using static information from JS file.

redux-thunk is also added to retrieve data from mockAPI.
